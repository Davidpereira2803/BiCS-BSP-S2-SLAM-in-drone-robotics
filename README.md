# BSP-S2-SLAM

This Repository stores the work of the BiCS BSP S2 of the student David Pereira de Magalhaes
The project consists of using ORB_SLAM3 to run simulations and use it with a Tello drone, in order to get a data set.
The data set is used in the app, that was developped and is available in this repository. 
The app consists of comparing different sensors in different environments doing SLAM and output results in a simple UI.
